In case of emergency, one does not have to browse from one app to another for getting things done.

1. It fetches the current location of the user using geo-coder and shows all the contact details of nearby hospitals and COVID testing centers, the user does not need to go to google maps to locate the hospitals, find the contact details and then copy the number to the dial pad.
2. It makes booking appointments with the local doctors much easier. The user just needs to fill a small form.
3. All the information related to the locally happening health checkup camps and blood donation camps etc. the users can also register their interest in those events.
4. An easy to use Interface always levels up the app user experience. We have focused typically on making our application approachable to various levels of society.
